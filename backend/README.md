# Backend (M1) — accounts, auth, integration tokens

The multi-tenant product API: signup/login, per-user **encrypted** integration
tokens, and agent-run history. This is roadmap milestone **M1** — the gate the
desktop shell (M3), the OAuth broker (M4), and semantic memory (M2) all build on.

**Multi-tenant by construction:** every repository method that touches user data
takes a `user_id` and filters on it, and every API route depends on
`current_user` (resolved from the bearer token). There is no code path that
returns one user's tokens, runs, or sessions to another.

## Run it

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt        # fastapi, uvicorn, cryptography, ...
uvicorn "backend.api:create_app" --factory --reload
# -> http://127.0.0.1:8000  (GET /health)
```

Dev uses SQLite at `./donald_data/backend.db` automatically. For Postgres, set
`DATABASE_URL` (and install the driver: `pip install "psycopg[binary]"`).

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/donald
export BACKEND_SECRET_KEY=$(python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())")
```

Migrations in `backend/migrations/*.sql` run automatically on first `open_db()`
and are tracked in a `_migrations` table, so startup is idempotent.

## Endpoints

| Method | Path | Auth | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| GET  | `/health` | — | Liveness + which DB engine is active |
| POST | `/auth/signup` | — | Create account (email, password, display_name, country, dob, accept_tos) → `{token, user}` |
| POST | `/auth/login` | — | `{token, user}` |
| GET  | `/auth/me` | bearer | Current user |
| POST | `/auth/logout` | bearer | Revoke the presented token |
| GET  | `/integrations` | bearer | Providers this user has connected |
| PUT  | `/integrations/{provider}` | bearer | Store an encrypted token payload |
| DELETE | `/integrations/{provider}` | bearer | Disconnect a provider |
| GET  | `/runs` | bearer | This user's agent-run history |

Auth is a browser/desktop-friendly opaque bearer token: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## Security

- **Passwords** — stdlib `scrypt` (memory-hard), random per-password salt, cost
  parameters stored with the hash, constant-time verify. No plaintext, ever.
- **Session tokens** — 256-bit random, stored only as a SHA-256 hash, with expiry
  and revocation. A DB leak yields no usable token.
- **Integration tokens** — Fernet (AES-128-CBC + HMAC) encrypted with
  `BACKEND_SECRET_KEY` before they touch the DB. A leak yields ciphertext.
- **Isolation** — enforced at the repository layer, not just the route layer
  (see `tests/test_backend.py::test_isolation_at_repo_layer`).

## Layout

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `db.py` | Connection + migration runner; SQLite / Postgres by `DATABASE_URL` |
| `migrations/` | Portable schema (`001_init.sql`) |
| `crypto.py` | `TokenCipher` — Fernet at-rest encryption for tokens |
| `passwords.py` | scrypt hash/verify |
| `repo.py` | `UserRepo` / `SessionRepo` / `TokenRepo` / `RunRepo` (the isolation boundary) |
| `api.py` | FastAPI app + `current_user` bearer dependency |

## Memory (M2)

Per-user semantic memory, in `memory.py` / `embeddings.py` / `memory_service.py`
(schema: `migrations/002_memory.sql`). Three tiers in one `memory_items` table:

- **facts** — durable profile ("prefers concise answers").
- **chunks** — embedded pieces of past conversations (RAG corpus).
- **episodes** — post-session summaries.

Each turn, the gateway injects `MemoryService.context_block(user_id, message)`
(profile + top-K relevant items) into the system prompt, then `remember(...)`
persists the exchange. Embeddings are stored as JSON and ranked by cosine in
Python over the user's (bounded) items — portable across SQLite/Postgres; see the
pgvector upgrade path noted in the migration.

The default `HashingEmbedder` is **lexical** and dependency-free (great for
dev/tests). For conceptual recall, plug a learned provider (Voyage/OpenAI/local)
that implements the `Embedder` protocol — nothing else changes. Fact extraction
is currently a first-person heuristic; the model-backed extractor + episodic
summarizer (running off a queue) are the planned upgrades.

## OAuth broker (M4)

One flow connects any provider for any user (`oauth.py`). Providers (Google,
GitHub, Slack; extend `PROVIDERS`) share the same connect → callback → refresh
path; per-provider client credentials come from env, and a provider with none set
is simply "not connectable" until configured.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/oauth/providers` | Per provider: `configured` (creds set) + `connected` (this user) |
| GET | `/oauth/{provider}/authorize` | Returns the provider consent URL to open |
| GET | `/oauth/{provider}/callback` | Exchanges the code, stores encrypted tokens, redirects to `/app` |

The `state` parameter is HMAC-signed and carries the user_id, so the callback
(which has no bearer header) still knows — and can prove — who it's for; a forged
or cross-user state fails verification (CSRF defense). `OAuthBroker.valid_token()`
transparently refreshes an expired access token when a refresh token is present.
Tokens are stored through `TokenRepo`, so they're Fernet-encrypted at rest.

## Billing (M5)

Stripe subscriptions in `billing.py` (schema: `migrations/003_billing.sql`).
Checkout and the customer portal are created through an injectable `StripeClient`;
**subscription state is defined by webhooks, not the checkout redirect** — the
redirect only tells the browser it's done, the signed webhook is what flips the
user to `pro`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| GET | `/billing/subscription` | `{ plan, status, current_period_end, configured }` |
| POST | `/billing/checkout` | Start Stripe Checkout → `{ url }` |
| POST | `/billing/portal` | Manage/cancel → `{ url }` |
| POST | `/billing/webhook` | Stripe → us; signature-verified |

Every webhook's `Stripe-Signature` is verified (`verify_stripe_signature`, the
`t=…,v1=…` HMAC scheme with a timestamp-tolerance) before it's trusted;
`checkout.session.completed` carries our `client_reference_id` (the user_id) so
we map the payment back to the right account, and `customer.subscription.*`
events look the user up by `stripe_customer_id`. Unconfigured (no keys) → the API
reports `configured: false` and checkout 400s rather than pretending.

## Next (not yet here)

- Wire `RunRepo` into the gateway's agent loop so runs are recorded per user.
- Rate-limit `/auth/*` (reuse `security/auth_ratelimit.py`).
- OAuth **refresh** handling on `TokenRepo` (M4 broker).
- `memory_*` tables + pgvector (M2).
